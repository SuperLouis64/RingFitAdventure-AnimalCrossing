# RingFitAdventure-AnimalCrossing
The Ring Fit Mod for Animal Crossing on the Nintendo Switch! With the release of Animal crossing, I've never felt so calm in my life. Who knew paying off debt and owning a home can be experienced in a game??? After a good amount of viewer requests I finally got around to making Animal Crossing more realistic. With this mod you'll be able to exercise and collect bells at the same time! Jog/Run IRL to move in game and swing your ringcon or fist to use your tools. It wouldn't be a ring fit mod unless we added a squat feature. Squat to use your Phone/open up your menu. Goodluck! If you end up using the mod for YouTube, Twitch, etc, all I ask is to be credited, don't be a jerk about it (seriously, don't make me put this stuff behind a different licences and patreon).

## Overall Design of the Mod
The idea was pretty simple, get a workout while doing some chores. You do not need the Ring Con to use this mod, but it's a bit more comfortable to have it.
- Jog/Run IRL to move in-game. The joystick for moving is locked until you move.
- Hold the Trigger and Squat in order to use the ZL button (phone)
- Swing your fist or squeeze the joycon to use your items (dig with the shovel for example).

### Hardware Needed
This mod does require additional hardware to get running. I will write a tutorial ASAP. Please visit the Titan Two's website for details on how to use it: https://www.consoletuner.com/products/titan-two/
- Titan Two Input Converter
- RingCon and Legstrap (not needed but helps)
- Titan Two Wireless Expansion Kit

### Software Needed
To interact with the Titan Two, you'll need to download Gtuner IV. "Gtuner IV is the main software for programming, updating and configuring the Titan Two device, featuring an complete IDE with integrated compiler for the GPC script language. Gtuner IV also provides user friendly interfaces for easy download, configure and use gamepacks or user made scripts. Based in a modern framework, Gtuner IV supports multi-platform, high resolution monitors and localization" - ConsoleTuner's site. 
- Download the software here: <https://www.consoletuner.com/titan-two-downloads/>
- Make sure to read over how the hardware/software works on the website. Message me if it still doesn't make sense but if I can figure it out you'll be fine!

### How to Set-up the Mod
I'm currently working on a better video tutorial, I'll link it once it's finished.

2. Connect your Titan Two to your PC via the PROG port

8. Workout to your heart's content!

### FAQ
- Q: Do I need the Wireless Expansion Kit?
- A: Yes, you can't connect to your Joycons without it

- Q: I'm having issues settings things up, what am I doing wrong?
- A: Shoot me a message on twitter on <https://twitter.com/SuperLouis_64>, the Titan Two is hard to set up the fist time.

- Q: This is a bit expensive, is there a cheaper option?
- A: At the moment no. Someone has figured out a way to connect the ringcon to PC but until that's public this is the only way I know of. I have started an Arduino project that will be my version of the Ring Fit Adventure Mod
